# Real-Time-Weapon Detection
## What's the problem?
> Due to rising weapons related crimes and deaths caused by the same, many institutions have adopted the use of CCTV for security surveillance. However, manual monitoring of security cameras is not enough to effectively detect and respond to such hazardous situations. Secondly, CCTV cameras are not intelligent. Thirdly, the existing systems do not map weapons do the intruders and are quite slow. Finally, CCTVs also require human vigilance at all times.  

## How do we solve it?

>The proposal is an early detection of weapons using deep learning techniques especially transfer learning to create a model that will detect weapons from a video surveillance feed in real time.

## Implementaion

> The system has been implemented using transfer learning of the YOLO "You only Look once" object detection model. Yolo has several vub models and yovov5s was choses since it is less resource intensive and fast. For UI implementation I used PYQT5. Backend was implemented using Python Django.
